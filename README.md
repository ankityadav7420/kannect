1. JavaScript Function: getPrimesInRange
  The getPrimesInRange function takes a range as input and returns all the prime numbers within that range. 
  It utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for efficient prime number generation.

# 2. Performance Metrics
* Time taken to run all instances of the function getPrimesInRange: This depends on the size of the input range and the hardware/software environment.
* Time taken to determine if a single number is prime or not in front of each number checked: This depends on the number itself but is generally fast.
* Time taken to determine if a number is prime or not in front of each number found prime: This also depends on the number but is generally fast.
* Average of time taken for primality checks for the given range: This can be calculated as the average time taken for all the prime numbers found.
